	"answer": "Indian employees who contributed to German social security system when they worked on a Work permit in Germany         The pension contributions should be less than 60 months.         No lower limit, it can be one month, 6 months or whatever.     Completed waiting period of 24 months after last contribution to German pension system (It is NOT waiting from date of leaving from Germany). e.g.          Employee worked till March 2014 and pension contribution was upto March 2014, then refund is possible from April 2016 onwards.         Employee worked till March 2014, but the pension was paid up-to September 2009 only, then refund is possible immediately after return from Germany that is March 2014. Waiting up-to April 2016 is not required.      Currently should be living out of Germany, UK \u0026 EU countries. So Indians living in countries like India, USA, Australia, Singapore, Switzerland, Canada, Indonesia, Japan etc. are eligible to get refund.",

There is no interest paid by German Govt. to the deposits.         People who paid for \u003c 5 years, can get employee contribution as refund.

Once  you get the refund, you can invest in India and get a better return and after 20 years it is going to be 4-5 times of employee contribution(with a conservative estimate of 8% return compounding).  You can get a much better pension on your own with this money. ",

	"answer": "Qualifying periods and accumulation of insurance times spent in different countries:  Similar to other European pension systems, the German statutory pension scheme requires a certain contribution period to qualify for a pension. The minimum insurance period for an entitlement to a German old-age pension is 5 years.  As an internationally mobile researcher it is important to know that social insurance in the and  is coordinated according to the EU Regulation 883/2004 on the Coordination of social security systems.  Following this principle, , and Switzerland as well as Partners to a bilateral  (\"Sozialversicherungsabkommen\") have to acknowledge periods during which pension rights have been accrued in these countries and have to count them together with respect to a certain qualifying period required.  Periods during which pension rights have been accrued in countries which do not have a  (\"Sozialversicherungsabkommen\") with Germany may not be added to the German periods in order to fulfil the prerequisites for entitlement. It is recommendable to inform yourself beforehand about the regulations valid in your country.  Once you retire your pension accumulated in the different countries should be paid by each single country individually. There are just a few exceptions aimed at avoiding mini-pensions. All social security providers award pensions on the basis of their own national legislation. This means, that under certain circumstances, you may be entitled to a pension in several different countries.",

	"question": "What do I need to do to if I want to work abroad for a time?",
	"answer": "To avoid any negative consequences, you should in this case seek advice from an expert at Deutsche Rentenversicherung.  The liability to pay compulsory insurance contributions based on employment or self-employment in a Member or Contracting State is determined primarily by the regulations of the state in which the employment or self-employment is performed. However, the European Law and agreements on Social Security do contain exceptions. If an employee, for example, is posted to another Member State or Contracting State for a limited period the German regulations will still apply. Therefore, German insurance periods are established even if the employment is carried on abroad.  If employed in another state without having been posted there by an employer, you should clarify whether or not the employment is liable to the payment of compulsory insurance contributions. If this is the case, you will not suffer any negative consequences. Under the provisions of the European Law or law governed by Social Security agreements these insurance periods can be taken into consideration for your pension entitlement. They will be aggregated to the German periods. If the employment is not liable to the payment of compulsory insurance contributions in the foreign country, you should possibly consider making payments of voluntary contributions.  If employed in a non contracting state where there was no posting arrangement, you should note that this period will not be taken into consideration in Germany. They will not be taken into account neither for establishing the actual entitlement nor for the computation of the pension amount.",

	"question": "How am I covered by social insurance if I work abroad temporarily for my German employer?",
	"answer": "If you are only sent by your German employer to another Member State for a temporary period and your employer continues to pay your salary, you are still liable to pay insurance contributions in Germany (your home state). This is called posting. What is important to this regard is that the posting is restricted to a specified period and that you do not replace another person posted abroad. The expected period of posting must not exceed the maximum period of 24 months. Before commencing your employment in another Member State, a certificate of posting must be requested on your behalf, which sets out under which pension scheme you will be insured during the posting period. The certificate of posting can be downloaded from the internet offer of “Deutsche Verbindungsstelle Krankenversicherung Ausland (DKVA)” (German health insurance fund foreign liaison office). If you are a member of the of a statutory health insurance fund, please send the claim to your health insurance fund. Persons who are not members of the statutory health insurance should send it to the responsible pension insurance institution.  More information on posting is also provided in our information brochure “Living and Working in Europe”.  If it is clear from the outset that the employment in another Member State will exceed the maximum period for a posting, in exceptional cases German law may still apply to the situation. In that case the Deutsche Verbindungsstelle Krankenversicherung – Ausland (DVKA) (German health insurance fund foreign liaison office) will contact the responsible institution in the other Member State prior to the commencement of the posting to agree upon an exception to the rule.  If you are regularly employed in at least two Member States simultaneously, the legal provisions of your state of residence will continuously apply in your case, if you predominantly perform your duties there.  Special conditions of the European Law apply for particular groups of persons. Please contact your pension insurance institution or DKVA in time.",

Under these regulations social security contributions must be deducted even in respect of seasonal workers with the exception of minor employments, for example in case of a short-term job up to a maximum of two months within one year.  Even if the European Law and law governed by agreements on social security apply the liability to pay social security contributions depends on the statutory provisions of the state in which the employment or self-employed activity is exercised. However, there are exceptions to this rule, for example if an employee is posted by his/her employer to Germany for a fixed period of time. In this case, the provisions of the state from which the posting is arranged will apply, i.e. no social security contributions will be deducted in Germany, but in turn no German insurance periods will be established.",

	"question": "How will a fixed term employment in Germany be taken into account for the calculation of a pension?",
	"answer": "Provided this fixed term employment is liable to the payment of insurance contributions, compulsory insurance periods are established by you. Whether based on these periods you can be entitled to a pension, depends among other factors on the total number of months you completed insurance periods in Germany. Thus, you cannot be entitled to a normal old age pension, unless you have completed the general qualifying period of five years. If the qualifying period has not been completed, no pension can be paid. Normally you can then claim a refund of contributions.  If the insured person has also completed insurance periods in another Member or Contracting State, the requirements for the payment of a pension can be also met by taking into account foreign insurance periods in addition to the German insurance periods. This means that the periods are totalised. However, a pension is only payable in this case, if the insured person completed the minimum insurance period in Germany, normally one year. If contributions were paid for a shorter period, these few German periods are taken into account by the insurance institution of the other Member State. Then there will be no longer any entitlement to a German pension. Some agreements on Social Security contain different regulations. If no regulation exists regarding a minimum insurance period, also a pension based on one month of contributions can be paid.",

	"question": "Totalisation of periods regarding a pension entitlement: How will my years of employment abroad be taken into account when my German pension entitlement is assessed?",
	"answer": "Insurance periods completed in another Member or Contracting State can be taken into account in the same way as German periods when assessing a German pension entitlement. If in the same month you have completed employment liable to the payment of pension insurance contributions both in Germany and in another state, there is an overlap of periods. However, when examining a pension entitlement, this month can only be taken into account once.  Under the European law insurance periods completed in another member state are taken into account when calculating the pension amount. Resulting from this calculation you will receive the share of the pension amount based on your German insurance periods. As foreign insurance periods may have a positive effect on the evaluation of your German periods, this pension amount is normally higher than the amount based on the calculation of your German insurance periods alone.  When calculating a pension amount under the regulations of an Agreement on Social Security the insurance periods completed in the Contracting State are normally not taken into account. In these cases the German pension will be entirely based on your German insurance contributions.  Insurance periods completed in non contracting states cannot be taken in account in Germany neither for the examination of a pension entitlement nor for the calculation of a pension.  If the qualifying conditions are met you may receive a separate pension from the foreign insurance institution.  Under any circumstances you should ask the responsible insurance institution of this country, whether based on the insurance periods completed there you can be entitled to a pension.",

	"question": "How are pension payments made abroad?",
	"answer": "A pension payment abroad is normally possible. However, please note that your stay abroad may have an effect on the amount of your pension, even if you keep your German bank account. To avoid unpleasant surprises, you should ask for information regarding your entitlement abroad well in advance. The mode of payment depends on the country where you stay.  When resident abroad you may opt to have the pension paid into your own account held with a foreign bank, or into your own German bank account. The transfer of a pension to a bank account abroad may result in bank charges or exchange rate losses, which are not compensated by Deutsche Rentenversicherung but are at your own expense. For payment of your pension in an EU Member State, the pension insurance institution requires your international bank code (Bank Identifier Code or BIC) and your international account number (International Bank Account Number, or IBAN). Ask your bank for this information. Your pension insurance institution will conduct an annual check to ascertain if you are still alive and if the pension will continue to be paid.If the pension is paid by US Dollar cheque, we are unable to assume costs resulting from the cashing of the cheque. Also exchange rate fluctuations resulting from the change into the local currency cannot be compensated by us.",

	"answer": "Since 2005 new rules have applied regarding taxation of pensions in Germany. Also German pensioners who stay abroad, are included in the tax liability. However, the taxes are not automatically deducted from the pension. The responsible German tax authority for pensioners living abroad is the “Finanzamt Neubrandenburg”. Based on a tax declaration which must be submitted by the pensioners this “Finanzamt” examines, if and to what extent the pension is liable to tax payments. To this regard the double taxation agreements are taken into consideration. For further information and claim forms please go to the website www.finanzamt-rente-im-ausland.de.",

With countries outside the European Union, bilateral agreements exist that govern the portability of pension rights. When the researcher retires, these rules will determine where and how much pension benefits the researcher receives.  There are, however, no EU rules relating to the portability of second pillar pension rights, although they are in preparation. There is therefore a risk that the researcher loses some of his/her entitlements as a consequence of his/her move.",

	"answer": "If you are living and working in Germany, it is worthwhile to understand how the German pension works. When it comes to planning for your retirement, even as a foreigner, you could be eligible to claim a German pension even if you no longer live in Germany. Alternatively, if you move outside the EU or won’t qualify for a pension in Germany, you may be able to opt for a German pension refund of your previously paid contributions.  The German pension system currently ranks 12th in the world and even internationals can claim a basic German pension from just five years of working in Germany. Regardless of whether you decide to retire in Germany or move to another country, you will have several decisions to make about your German pension contributions.  To qualify for a German state pension you naturally must meet certain criteria. Blacktower Expat Solutions GmbH provides a helpful guide to understand who can claim a pension in Germany (or die Rente, pension in German), what is the pension age, pension rates and conditions, and how to apply and contact your German pension office as an expat.",

Currently, the official pension age for women and men in Germany is 65 years old, but will be gradually increased to 67 years by 2029.  It is possible to claim early retirement in Germany if you have made contributions for at least 35 years, which will allow you to retire at 63 with a state pension, but the number of months you would have had to work until the German pension age of 65 (or 67 if born after 1963) will be deducted from your pension entitlement. As an example, retiring two years before the pension age could mean a reduction in your German pension of up to 14.5 percent.  However, if an individual has contributed for 45 years, they are eligible to retire at 63 without having any German pension entitlement deducted.",

	"question": "German pensions for expats working in Germany",
	"answer": "Expats working in Germany can participate in all levels of the three-pillar German pension system (explained below), providing they meet the criteria required by the German pension office.  As discussed above, if you worked in Germany and contributed for a sufficient period the mandatory gesetzliche Rentenversicherung (statutory pension insurance, under German social security) you should be able to claim a German pension. However, while living in Germany, at any time you can opt into company pension schemes or private German pension plans to secure your pension.  In some cases, even if you no longer live in Germany, you may still qualify for a pension in Germany as outlined by the Deutsche Rentenversichering Bund, provided you contributed for more than five years. There are also bi-lateral agreements between EU, EEA and non-EEA member states which make it possible to claim state pension payments from different countries.  In the case of EU citizens you can typically combine pension entitlements from two or more European countries; for example, if you worked and paid contributions for 20 years in the UK and 20 years in Germany, you can claim a pro-rata pension from each country regardless of which one you retire in. You will classed as a ‘German resident’ if you are a EU citizen, as will non-EU citizens if they legally live in a European member state or bi-lateral agreement country, otherwise a 30 percent deduction could apply to your German pension. It is important to check with the pension authority in your country of residence as claiming a German pension may affect your other pensions or tax requirements  For UK citizens retiring in Germany, there is also the possibility to benefit from QROPS plans. These are essentially offshore pension plans that allow you to transfer your UK company or personal pension schemes and accrued payments abroad. However, you must get approval by HRMC to qualify for a QROPS plan.  A QROPS typically provides additional benefits, besides unfreezing your UK pension equity so you have more pension entitlements to plan your retirement. These include eliminating double tax rates, reduced inheritance tax rates (that can be up to 55 percent upon death), less currency exchange fluctuation and more flexibility on the amount you can withdraw from your QROPS pension fund.",
